# BE.A-Mentor-GPT-Methodology
A repository guide to creating a custom building energy analysis using OpenAIs custom GPTs. The repository includes datasets we've created (based on other opensource data) to feed our example mentor and others are welcome to use these as knowledge inputs for their own GPT.

Welcome to **BE.AMentor**, an open-source repository dedicated to developing a custom GPT for building energy analysis. This project aims to aid building energy modeling and HVAC practitioners by providing insightful answers to questions about ASHRAE standards, guidelines, and various building energy modeling tools such as OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and DesignBuilder.

## Introduction

**BE.AMentor** leverages the power of OpenAI's custom GPT to assist practitioners in the building energy modeling field. By incorporating quantitative data from open-source datasets, including DOE's prototype buildings, our custom GPT provides accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Expert Guidance:** Get reliable answers to questions about ASHRAE standards and guidelines.
- **Modeling Support:** Assistance with tools like OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and DesignBuilder.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Incorporates data from DOE's prototype buildings and other open-source datasets.
- **Interactive Responses:** Engage with a dynamic and responsive custom GPT designed for energy analysis.

## Installation

To get started with **BE.AMentor**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BE.AMentor.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BE.AMentor
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use **BE.AMentor**, simply run the main script and start interacting with the custom GPT:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can ask questions about building energy modeling, ASHRAE standards, and more. Here are a few examples:

- *"What are the key ASHRAE guidelines for HVAC systems?"*
- *"How do I model a commercial building in EnergyPlus?"*
- *"What are the energy savings potential for using DOE's prototype buildings data?"*
