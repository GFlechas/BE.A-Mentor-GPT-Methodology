# BE.A-Mentor-GPT-Methodology
A repository guide to creating a custom building energy analysis using OpenAIs custom GPTs. The repository includes datasets we've created (based on other opensource data) to feed our example mentor and others are welcome to use these as knowledge inputs for their own GPT.

Sure! Here's a comprehensive and interactive GitHub README for the "BE.AMentor" project. The color scheme used will be inspired by the colors from your project logo.

## Overview

**BE.AMentor** (Building Energy Analysis Mentor) is an open-source project that provides a custom GPT to assist building energy modeling and HVAC practitioners with their questions regarding ASHRAE standards, guidelines, and building energy modeling tools such as OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and DesignBuilder. The project also integrates quantitative data from open-source datasets and tools, like DOE's prototype buildings, to enrich the responses provided by the custom GPT.
