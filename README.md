## Introduction

**BE.AMentor** leverages the power of OpenAI's custom GPT to assist practitioners in the building energy modeling field. By incorporating quantitative data from open-source datasets, including DOE's prototype buildings, our custom GPT provides accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Expert Guidance:** Get reliable answers to questions about ASHRAE standards and guidelines.
- **Modeling Support:** Assistance with tools like OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and DesignBuilder.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Incorporates data from DOE's prototype buildings and other open-source datasets.
- **Interactive Responses:** Engage with a dynamic and responsive custom GPT designed for energy analysis.

## Installation

To get started with **BE.AMentor**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BE.AMentor.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BE.AMentor
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use **BE.AMentor**, simply run the main script and start interacting with the custom GPT:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can ask questions about building energy modeling, ASHRAE standards, and more. Here are a few examples:

- *"What are the key ASHRAE guidelines for HVAC systems?"*
- *"How do I model a commercial building in EnergyPlus?"*
- *"What are the energy savings potential for using DOE's prototype buildings data?"*
